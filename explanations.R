If a value is missing for only one of the two variables, it will be near 0 for the variable that is missing but at the appropriate value for the axis where a variable is present. e.g., if a missing value is placed at 80 along the x-axis, and is near the axis, the y-variable was not measured (and is presumably 0, unless it was truly missing data).</p>
